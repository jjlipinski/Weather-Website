# Weather-Website
A website to display the current and future weather forcasts for a specified location.
The API suports searching by address, partial address, latitude/longitude, or zip code.
Example for latitude/longitude location search: Enter "38.9697,-77.385" into the search bar.

I am using the Visual Crossing Weather API and their Weather Icons.
